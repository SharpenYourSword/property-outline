\section{Co-Ownership and Marital Interests}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Focus: \emph{concurrent} interests in present or future possession.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Common Law Concurrent Interests}

\subsubsection{Types, Characteristics, and Creation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Three main types:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Tenants in common}: separate but undivided 
        interests.\footnote{Casebook p. 319.}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Example: O conveys property to A and B.
            \item The interest of each is descendable and may be conveyed by 
            deed or will.
            \item No survivorship rights---i.e., the interests are distinct 
            even if one owner dies.
            \item Each tenant owns an undivided share of the whole.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Joint tenants}: regarded as a single 
        owner.\footnote{Casebook p. 320.}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Both have a right of survivorship---so if one dies, that 
            tenant's interest is simply extinguished.\
            \item Four unities are required:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \emph{Time}: all interests must be acquired or vest 
                simultaneously.
                \item \emph{Title}: all interests must be acquired by the same 
                instrument or by joint adverse possession.
                \item \emph{Interest}: all must have equal undivided shares 
                and identical interests measured by duration.
                \item \emph{Possession}: each must have a right to possession 
                of the whole. After the joint tenancy is created, one joint 
                tenant can voluntarily give exclusive possession to another.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item If any unity is lacking, a tenancy in common is created.
            \item If any unities are later severed, the joint tenancy becomes 
            a tenancy in common. Any one joint tenant can unilaterally convert 
            a joint tenancy into a tenancy in common by conveying his interest 
            to a third party. 
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Tenancy by the entirety}: created only in husband and 
        wife.\footnote{Casebook p. 321.}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Requires the four unities, plus a fifth---marriage.
            \item Today it exists in less than half the states.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Common law favored joint tenancies over tenancies in common. Today, 
    the situation is reversed.
    \item Historically, A and B could not hold joint tenancy if they occupied 
    unequal shares. This rule is mostly ignored today.\footnote{Casebook p. 
    324.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problems on Creation of Joint Tenancies}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item O conveys property to A, B, and C as joint tenants. Subsequently A 
    conveys his interest to D. Then B dies intestate, leaving H as his 
    heir.\footnote{Casebook p. 322 problem 1.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the state of the title? % TODO
        \item What if B had died leaving a will devising his interest to H?
