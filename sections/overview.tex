\section{Overview}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Subsequent possession.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item % TODO
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Possessory estates.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Fee simple absolute.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Potentially infinite.
            \item Common law: ``and his heirs.''
            \item Inheritance: first issue, parents, collaterals.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Fee tail.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Descends to grantee's lineal descendants.
            \item Common law: ``and the heirs of his body.''
            \item When it ends, it reverts to the grantor's heirs.
            \item Only five states recognize it. Others convert the language 
            into some kind of life estate or fee simple.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Life estate.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Today, most are created in trust.
            \item Future interest holders can sue to prevent waste. 
            \emph{Woodrick v. Wood.}
            \item If a conveyance is ambiguous, courts prefer to interpret it 
            as creating a fee simple. \emph{White v. Brown.}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Leasehold estate.
        \item Defeasible estate.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Ends prior to its natural endpoint when a specified event 
            occurs.
            \item Used mainly to control behavior or land use.
            \item Three types:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \emph{Fee simple determinable}: durational. Ends 
                automatically. Future interest: possibility of reverter.
                \item \emph{Fee simple subject to condition subsequent}: 
                conditional. \emph{May} be cut short. Future interest: right 
                of entry.
                \item \emph{Fee simple subject to executory limitation}: a 
                third party transferee has the right to take possession of the 
                property if conditions are satisfied. Future interest: 
                executory interest.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Restraints on alienation.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Disabling}: a grantee cannot transfer his interest.
            \item \emph{Forfeiture}: a grantee loses his interest if he attempts to 
            transfer it.
            \item \emph{Promissory}: a grantee promises not to transfer his 
            interest. Enforceable through contract remedies.
            \item A use restriction creates a valid FSSCS even if it 
            effectively creates an absolute restraint on 
            alienation. \emph{Mountain Brow Lodge v. Toscano.}
        \end{enumerate}
        % TODO: transferability of future interests?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
