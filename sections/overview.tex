\subsection{Possessory Estates}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fee simple absolute.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Potentially infinite.
        \item Common law: ``and his heirs.''
        \item Inheritance: first issue, parents, collaterals.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Fee tail.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Descends to grantee's lineal descendants.
        \item Common law: ``and the heirs of his body.''
        \item When it ends, it reverts to the grantor's heirs.
        \item Only five states recognize it. Others convert the language into 
        some kind of life estate or fee simple.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Life estate.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Today, most are created in trust.
        \item Future interest holders can sue to prevent waste.  
        \emph{Woodrick v. Wood.}
        \item If a conveyance is ambiguous, courts prefer to interpret it as 
        creating a fee simple. \emph{White v. Brown.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Leasehold estate.
    \item Defeasible estate.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Ends prior to its natural endpoint when a specified event 
        occurs.
        \item Used mainly to control behavior or land use.
        \item Three types:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Fee simple determinable}: durational. Ends 
            automatically. Future interest: possibility of reverter.
            \item \emph{Fee simple subject to condition subsequent}: 
            conditional. \emph{May} be cut short. Future interest: right of 
            entry.
            \item \emph{Fee simple subject to executory limitation}: a third 
            party transferee has the right to take possession of the property 
            if conditions are satisfied. Future interest: executory interest.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Restraints on alienation.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Disabling}: a grantee cannot transfer his interest.
        \item \emph{Forfeiture}: a grantee loses his interest if he attempts 
        to transfer it.
        \item \emph{Promissory}: a grantee promises not to transfer his 
        interest. Enforceable through contract remedies.
        \item A use restriction creates a valid FSSCS even if it effectively 
        creates an absolute restraint on alienation. \emph{Mountain Brow Lodge 
        v. Toscano.}
    \end{enumerate}
    % TODO: transferability of future interests?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future Interests}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Remainder, executory interest, reversion, possibility of reverter, 
    right of entry.
    \item Restatement (Third) reforms:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item All five interests are combined as ``future interests.''
        \item It reduces the traditional categories---indefeasibly vested, 
        vested subject to complete defeasance, vested subject to open, and 
        contingent---to two: vested and contingent.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Class gifts to to a class that is still open to new members is 
    classified as \textbf{subject to open}---e.g., ``to A for life, and then 
    to B's children.''
    \item \textbf{Future interests in the transferor}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Reversion}: grantor's vested interest after transferring 
        a \textbf{vested estate of a lesser quantum}. E.g., when O conveys 
        ``to A for life,'' O has a reversion.
        \item \textbf{Possibility of reverter}: grantor's vested interest 
        after carving out a \textbf{determinable estate of the same quantum}. 
        It almost always arises when carving out a \textbf{FSD} out of an FSA. 
        E.g., when O conveys ``to A so long as used for school purposes,'' O 
        has a possibility of reverted.
        \item \textbf{Right of entry}: grantor's vested interest when he 
        transfers a \textbf{FSSCS}. E.g., O conveys ``to A, but if it ceases 
        to be used for school purposes, O can reenter and retake the 
        premises.''
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Future interests in the transferee}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Remainder}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Vested}: (1) given to an ascertained person and (2) 
            not subject to a condition precedent. ``~.~.~.~waits politely 
            until the termination of the preceding possessory 
            estate~.~.~.''\footnote{Casebook p. 258.}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \emph{Indefeasibly vested}: cannot be divested. E.g., 
                ``to A for life, then to B and her heirs.'' B has an 
                indefeasibly vested remainder.
                \item \emph{Subject to divestment}: vested, but can be 
                divested if an event happens. E.g., ``to A for life, then to B 
                and her heirs, but if B does not survive A, to C and his 
                heirs.''\footnote{Casebook p. 261 example 8.} B has a vested 
                remainder subject to divestment.
                \item \emph{Vested subject to open} (or \emph{subject to 
                partial divestment}): later-born children can share in the 
                gift. E.g., ``to A for life, then to A's children and their 
                heirs.'' At the time of the conveyance, A has one child, B. B 
                has a vested remainder subject to open because A could have 
                more children before she dies.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Contingent}: (1) given to an unascertained person or 
            (2) contingent upon an event other than the natural termination of 
            the preceding estates. E.g., ``to A for life, then to the heirs of 
            B.'' The remainder is contingent because the heirs of B cannot be 
            ascertained until B dies.\footnote{Casebook p. 260 example 5.}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Executory interest}: divests or cuts short an interest 
        in another transferee (\emph{shifting}) or divest the transferor in 
        the future (\emph{springing}).
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item E.g., ``to A and his heirs, but if A dies without issue 
            surviving him, to B and his heirs.'' B has an executory interest, 
            which can only become possessory by divesting A.\footnote{Casebook 
            p. 268.}
            \item Vests automatically, like a possibility of reverter, but 
            \emph{not} like a right of entry.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Executory interest vs. remainder}: ``The difference 
        between taking possession as soon as the prior estate ends and 
        divesting the prior estate is the essential difference between a 
        remainder and an executory interest.''\footnote{Casebook p. 259.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Trust}: the trustee holds legal title to the trust property 
    and manages it for the benefit of the beneficiaries, who hold equitable 
    title. Trusts can be \textbf{inalienable} and \textbf{beyond the reach of 
    creditors}. \emph{Broadway Natl. Bank v. Adams} and Gray, ``Restraints on 
    Alienation of Property.'' This system can perpetuate wealth inequality, 
    but it can also protect indigent trustees.
    \item \textbf{Rules furthering marketability by destroying contingent 
    future interests}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Doctrine of destructability of contingent remainders}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item ``A legal remainder in land is destroyed if it does not vest 
            at or before the termination of the preceding freehold 
            estate.''\footnote{Casebook p. 281.}
            \item E.g., O conveys ``to A for life, then to B if B reaches 
            21.'' If A dies before B is 21, B's interest is destroyed.
            \item \textbf{Merger}: ``if the life estate and the next vested 
            estate in fee simple come into the hands of one person, the lesser 
            estate is merged into the larger.''\footnote{Casebook p. 282.}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item E.g., O conveys to A for life, remainder to B. If A 
                conveys her life estate to B, the life estate merges into B's 
                remainder, giving B a fee simple.
                \item E.g., O conveys to A for life, and then to B if B 
                survives A.  A conveys his life estate to O. The life estate 
                merges with O's fee simple, giving O a fee simple and 
                destroying B's contingent remainder.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Doctrine of worthier title}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If O conveys to A for life, and then to O's heirs, the 
            remainder in O's heirs is invalid and O gets a reversion. Plugged 
            a feudal tax loophole; mostly obsolete today.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Rule against perpetuities}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The rule applies only to interests that are \textbf{not 
            vested at the time of conveyance}: contingent remainders, 
            executory interests, and class gifts.
            \item Gray: ``No interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, 
            not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the 
            creation of the interest.''\footnote{Casebook p. 285.}
            \item Analyzing an RAP problem:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Identify the interests.
                \item Will each interest vest within the perpetuity period of 
                \emph{any} \textbf{life in being plus 21 years}? If you can 
                \emph{prove} that it will, then the interest is valid. But if 
                you cannot prove the existence of scenario where it would 
                vest, the interest is invalid.
                \item If one or more interests is invalid, what is the remedy 
                for the violation of the RAP?\footnote{Reader p. 73.} (The 
                typical remedy is to strike the invalid remedy, but see the 
                reforms below.)
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Examples:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Valid: O transfers land ``in trust for A to life, then 
                to A's first child to reach 21.'' A is the validating life. 
                The interest in A's first child to reach 21 will necessarily 
                vest prior to A's life plus 21 years. Since you can prove that 
                the interest must vest within this period, the remainder is 
                valid.\footnote{Casebook pp. 286--87.}
                \item Invalid: O transfers land ``in trust to A for life, then 
                to A's first child to reach 25.'' The interest will not 
                necessarily vest before after A's life plus 21 years. Thus, 
                the remainder is invalid.
                \item Invalid: to A and his heirs so long as used for school 
                purposes, and then to B and his heirs. The interest will not 
                necessarily vest or terminate within A or B's lifetimes.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item The RAP does not apply to reversionary interests, including 
            possibilities of reverter. \emph{Brown v. Independent Baptist 
            Church of Woburn}. (But it should---this is a loophole.)
            \item The \emph{Klamath Falls} problem: O conveys ``to A and his 
            heirs so long as used as a library, and then to B and his heirs.'' 
            B's remainder is invalid because it it is not certain to vest or 
            fail within 21 years after the death of A or B. But O can get 
            around this problem by conveying an FSD to A and then transferring 
            the possibility of reverter. This is valid because the RAP does 
            not apply to interests in the transferor (reversion, possibility 
            of reverter, right of entry). \emph{City of Klamath 
            Falls v. Flitcraft}. So maybe the RAP \emph{should} apply to those 
            interests.
            \item (jee v. audley) % TODO
            \item A future interest is invalid under the RAP even if it 
            actually vests within the perpetuities period. \emph{The Symphony 
            Space, Inc. v. Pergola Properties, Inc.} (The USRAP abolished the 
            application of the RAP to options and other commercial 
            transactions.\footnote{Casebook p. 304.})
            \item Justifications:\footnote{See Simes, ``Public Policy and the 
            Dead Hand.''}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Increase alienability and productivity.
                \item Limit wealth concentration.
                \item It's socially undesirable for people to have assured 
                incomes because it limits social Darwinism.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item Reforms:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \emph{Cy pres}: the court rewrites an instrument to 
                avoid an RAP violation in a way that conforms to the 
                transferor's intent.
                \item \emph{Wait-and-see}: the interest is not invalid if it 
                actually vests within the statutory period. Cf. \emph{Symphony 
                Space} above.
                \item \emph{USRAP}: like wait-and-see but with a fixed 90 year 
                period.
            \end{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Perpetual trust}: many states have exempted trusts 
            from the RAP.
