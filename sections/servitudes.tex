\section{Private Land Use Controls: The Law of Servitudes}

\subsection{Easements}

\subsubsection{Background}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Servitudes create interests in land that bind and benefit the 
    parties to an agreement and their successors.\footnote{Casebook p. 763.}
    \item There is much functional overlap between the doctrinal categories of 
    servitudes. But is it necessary?
    \item Modern servitudes are products of the nineteenth century, following 
    the enclosure movement and urbanization.
    \item \textbf{Affirmative easement}: the right to perform an act on 
    servient land.\footnote{Casebook p. 767.}
    \item \textbf{Negative easement}: forbids a landowner from doing something 
    that might harm his neighbor.
    \item \textbf{Easement appurtenant}: grants a right to the owner of the 
    land that benefits from the easement to make use of another's land, i.e., 
    it benefits the land belonging to the easement owner. Usually 
    transferable.
    \item \textbf{Easement in gross}: grants a right to some person, 
    regardless of ownership of land, to make use of another's land, i.e., it 
    benefits the easement owner directly. 
    \item If the parties' intent is unclear, courts resolve the ambiguity in 
    favor of creating an easement appurtenant.
    \item \textbf{Dominant tenement}: the property that the easement benefits.
    \item \textbf{Servient tenement}: the property to which the easement 
    applies.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Creation of Easements}

\paragraph{\emph{Willard v. First Church of Christ, Scientist}}
~\\\\
Unlike at common law, grantors can create easements in third parties.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item McGuigan owned lots 19 and 20. She allowed churchgoers to park in 
    lot 20. She sold lot 19 to Peterson. Peterson wanted to resell it, so he 
    listed it with Willard, a realtor. Willard wanted to buy lots 19 and 20, 
    so Peterson conveyed both to him by deed in fee simple.
    \item But, Peterson did not own lot 20 when he agreed to convey it to 
    Willard, so he offered to buy it from McGuigan. She was willing to sell 
    as long as the church could continue to use the lot for parking. The deed 
    from McGuigan to Peterson for lot 20 included an easement for church 
    purposes.
    \item Willard then received the deed for lot 20 from Peterson, which did 
    not contain the language creating the easement, though Peterson told 
    Willard that the church would want to use the lot for parking.
    \item Willard learned of the easement several months later. He sued to 
    quiet title against the church.
    \item The trial court held that McGuigan and Peterson intended to convey 
    an easement, but that it was invalid because of the ``common law rule that 
    one cannot `reserve' an interest in property to a stranger to the 
    title.''\footnote{Casebook p. 769.} The rule was based on a feudal desire 
    to limit conveyances by deed in favor of conveyances by livery of seisin.
    \item Many courts have found ways of circumventing this rule, and at least 
    two states have discarded it.\footnote{Casebook p. 771.}
    \item Willard argued that the old rule should nonetheless apply because 
    grantees and title insurers relied on it, but the court found no evidence 
    to support his claim.
    \item ``~.~.~.~in the instant case the balance falls in favor of the 
    grantor's intent, and the old common law rule may not be applied to defeat 
    her intent.''\footnote{Casebook p. 772.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Licenses}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{License}: permission to allow the licensee to do something 
    that would otherwise be a trespass---e.g., plumbers, dinner guests.
    \item Licenses are revocable. Easements are not.
    \item However, there are two circumstances in which a license is not 
    revocable:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A license coupled with an interest, e.g., the right to harvest 
        timber from the grantor's land.
        \item A license can become irrevocable under the rules of estoppel. 
        See \emph{Holbrook} below.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Irrevocable License by Estoppel: \emph{Holbrook v. Taylor}}
~\\\\
If the licensee has made substantial improvements in reliance on the license, 
the licensor is estopped from revoking the license.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Facts:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 1942: The Holbrooks bought the property in question.
        \item 1944: The Holbrooks granted permission for a road to be cut to 
        haul coal from a mine.
        \item 1949: The mine closed and the road was no longer used.
        \item 1957: The Holbrooks built a house and leased it. The Holbrooks 
        and the tenants used the road.
        \item 1961: The tenant house burned down and was not rebuilt.
        \item 1964: The Taylors bought property next to the Holbrooks' and 
        built a house. Until 1965, the Holbrooks gave permission for the 
        Taylors to use the road.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Precedent supported the view that ``a right to the use of a roadway 
    over the lands of another may be established by 
    estoppel.''\footnote{Casebook p. 775.}
    \item After 1965, it was disputed whether the Taylors used the road by 
    permission or claim of right. The Taylors argued that it was used by them 
    and others without the Holbrooks' permission.
    \item In 1970, the Holbrooks apparently wanted to require the Taylors to 
    buy the land containing the road for \$500.
    \item The court held that several factors---the right to get to their 
    home, the use of the road for construction, and improvements---granted an 
    irrevocable license by estoppel to the Taylors to use the 
    road.\footnote{Casebook p. 777.}

\paragraph{Easement by Implied Reservation: \emph{Van Sandt v. Royster}}
~\\\\
An easement by reservation is valid when the prior use was reasonably 
apparrent.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Bailey owned three adjacent lots. She built an underground sewer to 
    connect the lots to a public sewer on the street. Van Sandt, the 
    plaintiff, acquired the lot closest to the road (lot 19). Royster, the 
    defendant, acquired the adjacent lot (lot 20).
    \item Van Sandt discovered that his basement was flooded with sewage. He 
    sued to prevent the defendants from draining their sewage across his land.
    \item The trial court found an appurtenant easement, holding for 
    defendants.
    \item On appeal, Van Sandt argued that there was never an easement 
    created in his land, and if there was, he took the premises free from any 
    easement because there was no actual or constructive 
    notice.\footnote{Casebook p. 780.}
    \item Royster argued that Bailey (the original owner of the lots) created 
    an easement by implied reservation when she severed the lots. Royster's 
    backup theory was that he had a valid easement by prescription.
    \item \textbf{Easement by grant}: an owner grants an easement to another. 
    It favors the grantee.\footnote{See \emph{Understanding Property} p. 530.}
    \item \textbf{Easement by reservation}: an owner conveys part of his 
    property to a grantee but retains an easement by reservation. It favors 
    the grantor.
    \item The court considered various approaches to the differences between 
    easements by implied grant and implied reservation.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Some courts: unless implied by necessity, a grantor should not 
        be able to reserve an easement by implication.
        \item Other courts: there should \emph{never} be an implied easement 
        by reservation.
        \item Still others: there is no difference between an implied 
        reservation and a grant.
        \item This court: necessity is a factor in determining whether the 
        easement was implied by reservation, but it is not determinative. 
        Here, the implied reservation was permissible.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The court here held that an owner cannot have an easement in his 
    own land, but he can have a ``quasi-easement'' if one part of the land is 
    necessary for the benefit of another. It held that an implied reservation 
    exists when the grantee knew or reasonably should have known of the prior 
    use. It doesn't matter whether the use was visible to the naked eye as 
    long as the use was reasonably apparent (e.g., underground sewers).
    \item Because the court held that there was a valid easement by 
    reservation, it did not reach the question of whether there was a 
    prescriptive easement.
    \item Affirmed.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Implied Easements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Easement implied from a prior existing use}, i.e., a 
    quasi-easement: apparent and continuous use. The easement protects the 
    probable intentions of the grantor and grantee to create an 
    easement.\footnote{Casebook p. 785.} \emph{Van Sandt v. Royster.}
    \item \textbf{Easement by necessity}: the easement is necessary for the 
    enjoyment of the land, and the necessity arose upon severance of the 
    dominant and servient parcels.\footnote{Casebook p. 785.} \emph{Othen v. 
    Rosier.}
    \item Necessity might be a factor in establishing whether an easement is 
    implied from an existing use, but the two are distinct.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Old rule: ``strict necessity is required for implied easements 
        in favor of the grantor.''\footnote{Casebook p. 785.} At least one 
        jurisdiction has required prior use, not recognizing necessity as 
        sufficient.
        \item Most jurisdictions: only reasonable necessity is required, 
        regardless of whether the easement is implied in favor of the grantor 
        or grantee.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item An easement by necessity is implied either because of \textbf{public 
    policy} (access to landlocked land) or \textbf{the parties' intent} 
    (presumably the grantor intended the land to be 
    accessible).\footnote{Casebook pp. 792--93.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Easement Implied by Necessity: \emph{Othen v. Rosier}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Othen owned land that could only access the public highway by 
    crossing Rosier's land. The Rosiers maintained a road which they used for 
    farming needs and which Othen used to access his land.
    \item The Rosiers constructed a levee that flooded the road, rendering it 
    unusable. Othen sued for an injunction to recognize an easement.
    \item The trial court held that Othen had an easement by necessity.
    \item The appellate court reversed, finding that there was no easement.
    \item Before the Supreme Court of Texas, Othen claimed an easement both of 
    necessity and by prescription. (An easement by prescription arises from 
    adverse use for a certain period---like adverse possession, but creating 
    an easement rather than a possessory right; see \emph{Van Valkenburgh}).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \emph{Easement of necessity}: no. An easement of necessity 
        arises when an owner severs two parcels, making it necessary to cross 
        one parcel to access the other. It \emph{only} arises when the 
        sevrance causes the land to be landlocked. In this case, Hill owned 
        Othen's and the Rosiers' land as well as the surrounding land. Upon 
        severance, there might have been several other ways to access Othen's 
        lot. Othen failed to show that use of the road on the Rosiers' lot was 
        \emph{necessary}, rather than merely 
        \emph{convenient}.\footnote{Casebook p. 789.}
        \item \emph{Easement by prescription}: no. An easement by prescription 
        arises from adverse use. Othen's use of the Rosiers' road was not 
        adverse because it was permissive and therefore constituted a 
        license.\footnote{Casebook p. 791.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Othen did not have an easement because he failed to prove that 
    access to the Rosiers' road was necessary. Affirmed.
    \item Othen could have successfully argued (1) that there was an implied 
    easement by reservation on the basis of prior use (but Texas does not 
    allow easements by implied reservation without necessity), or (2) that he 
    had a license to use the road that had become irrevocable through 
    estoppel.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problems on Easements by Necessity}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A owns five tracts of land. Lots 1--4 surround lot 5. A purchased 
    each lot from O in separate transactions. A dies intestate, leaving lot 1 
    to B, 2 to C, 3 to D, 4 to E, and 5 to F (so F has the landlocked lot). 
    There is no mention of an easement for F on lot 5. F sues the owners of 
    lots 1--4, claiming an easement by necessity. What 
    result?\footnote{Casebook p. 793 problem 2.}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Easements by Prescription}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Similar to adverse possession, but leading to use, not possession.
    \item \emph{Fiction of the lost grant}: ``[i]f use was shown to have 
    existed for 20 years, it was presumed that a grant of easement had been 
    made and that the grant had been lost.'' In other words, it granted an 
    easement after 20 years of adverse use on the fiction that the owner had 
    made a grant.\footnote{Casebook p. 795.} The lost grant theory confuses 
    acquiescence and permission.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problems on Prescriptive Easements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Say A built a road across O's land in 1982. In 1994, O writes a 
    letter telling A to stop using the road. A ignores O's letter and 
    continues to use the road until 2002. The prescriptive period is 20 
    years.\footnote{Casebook p. 796.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Does A have a prescriptive easement under the lost grant theory?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item % TODO ~\\\\\\\\\\\\
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Does A have a prescriptive easement under the adverse use 
        theory?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item ``In a jurisdiction not following the fiction of the lost 
            grant, to prevent a prescriptive easement from being acquired, the 
            owner must effectively interrupt or stop the adverse 
            use.''\footnote{Casebook p. 796.} O's letter is insufficient 
            to interrupt A's adverse use, so A acquires a prescriptive 
            easement.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item What if instead of writing a letter, O put up a fence blocking 
        the road?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item O's action would have interrupted A's use. Prescriptive 
            easements, like adverse possession, require continuous use. A 
            would not have a prescriptive easement. 
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item A owns a house next to a golf course. Every day, several golf balls 
    end up on his lawn, and golfers come to retrieve them.\footnote{Casebook 
    p. 797.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If this continues, will the golf course acquire a prescriptive 
        easement?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Yes, because course's licensees will have met the 
            requireements.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item What could A do to prevent a prescriptive easement?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item He could post a sign giving golfers permission to retrieve 
            their balls, which would negate the adverse use requirement. 
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Negative Easements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``A negative easement is the right of the dominant owner to stop the 
    servient owner from doing something on the servient 
    land.''\footnote{Casebook p. 842.}
    \item English courts recognized four types of negative easements, 
    preventing a neighbor from blocking windows, blocking air, removing 
    support from a building, and interfering with water flow.
    \item American courts accepted the English restrictions on the creation of 
    new negative easements, though there are persuasive policy reasons in 
    favor of the opposite approach.\footnote{Casebook p. 843--45.}
    \item American courts have recognized a few new negative easements, 
    including the right to an unobstructed view and the right to sunlight (for 
    solar energy).

\subsubsection{Termination of Easements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item There are several ways an easement can end:\footnote{Casebook p. 
    841--42.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The easement owner can agree to \textbf{release} it.
        \item The easement can \textbf{expire} at the end of a stated period 
        or upon the occurrence of a state event (as with a defeasible 
        easement).
        \item It can \textbf{merge} if the easement owner acquires the 
        servient estate.
        \item It can end when the \textbf{necessity ends}.
        \item \textbf{Estoppel}.
        \item \textbf{Abandonment}.
        \item It can end by \textbf{condemnation} if the government exercises 
        its eminent domain power to take a fee interest in the servient 
        estate.
        \item It can end by \textbf{prescription} if the servient owner 
        wrongfully and physically prevents the easement from being used for 
        the prescriptive period.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Traditionally, courts could not modify easements according to 
    changed conditions (though they could change real covenants and equitable 
    servitudes), though this is changing (e.g., with the Restatement Third).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Covenants Running with the Land}

\subsubsection{Egan, ``The Serene Fortress''}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Americans increasingly live in gated communities, governed by 
    private covenants.\footnote{Casebook p. 922.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Historical Background}

\paragraph{Covenants Enforceable at Law: Real Covenants}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Common law courts refused to recognize new types of negative 
    easements, so landowners turned to contract law. They wanted contract 
    rights regarding land use to be enforceable against both the promisor 
    landowner and his successors in title.\footnote{Casebook p. 847.}
    \item Bargains between neighboring landowners enables efficient allocation 
    of resources by arranging land uses to minimize conflicts.
    \item However, at common law, contract rights and obligations were only 
    binding on the promisor and promisee. They were not assignable.  The 
    promisor's successors in title were not bound by the original agreement. 
    So, landowners needed a \textbf{property right} to make the promise 
    binding on future holders of the title.
    \item One exception was that contracts were assignable by and against 
    assignees where there is \textbf{privity of estate}.\footnote{Casebook p. 
    848.}
    \item It was long established that privity of estate existed between a 
    landlord and tenant. So, for instance, if a landlord and tenant reached a 
    land use agreement, the tenant could enforce the agreement against future 
    landlords.
    \item Landowners tried but failed to expand privity of estate to 
    neighbors.
    \item However, American courts \emph{did} recognize privity of estate 
    beyond the landlord-tenant relationship. The \textbf{real covenant} 
    allowed land use promises to run with the land in favor of and against 
    successive owners.\footnote{Casebook p. 849.}
    \item Example: B, owner of Blackare, promises A that Blackacre will not be 
    used for industrial purposes. A ownes Whiteacre. B sells Blackacre to C 
    and A sells Whiteacre to D. Will the covenant run to C and 
    D?\footnote{Casebook p. 849.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If A sued B, the covenant will be enforced because A and B are 
        in privity of contract.
        \item B holds the servient tenement and bears the \emph{burden} of the 
        covenant. Upon sale, the burden runs to C.
        \item A holds the dominant tenement and bears the \emph{benefit} end 
        of the covenant. Upon sale, the benefit runs to D.
        \item ``~.~.~.~the test for the running of the burden is traditionally 
        more onerous than the test for running of the 
        benefit.''\footnote{Casebook p. 849.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Horizontal privity}: between the original covenanting 
    parties, i.e., A and B.
    \item \emph{Vertical privity}: between successors in interest, i.e., B 
    and C, and A and D.
    \item In American (but not English) courts, A and B's horizontal privity 
    means they are also in privity of estate. ``Giving privity this meaning 
    allows enforcement of the covenant against successors when the covenant is 
    created in conjunction with the transfer of some other interest in land, 
    for example, a deed conveying a fee simple, but not 
    otherwise.''\footnote{Casebook p. 850.}
    \item The Restatement First required horizontal privity for the 
    \emph{burden} of a covenant to run, but not the \emph{benefit}.
    \item The Restatement First's rule has been universally rejected. Now, 
    \textbf{courts do not require privity of estate for covenants to run}, 
    although some courts apparently retain this requirement in 
    dicta.\footnote{Casebook p. 851.}
    \item A real covenant can be negative or positive. It is enforceable only 
    if the assignee has notice of it.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Covenants Enforceable in Equity: Equitable Servitudes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item An \textbf{equitable servitude} ``is a covenant respecting the use 
    of land enforceable against successor owners or possessors in equity 
    regardless of its enforceability at law.''\footnote{Casebook p. 857.}
    \item The parties must \emph{intend} the promise to run, the subsequent 
    purchaser must have \emph{notice} of the covenant, and the covenant must 
    \emph{``touch or concern the land.''}\footnote{Casebook p. 857.}
    \item Horizontal privity is irrelevant.
    \item Vertical privity is not required for the \emph{burden} to run. The 
    \emph{benefit} runs to all assignees. Jurisdictions are split on whether a 
    covenant created for a third-party beneficiary is enforceable if the 
    third-party beneficiary did not acquire title from the original 
    covenantee.
    \item Equitable servitudes are interests in land. Unlike real covenants, 
    they attach to the land itself, not to the estate in land (an equitable 
    servitude ``sinks its tentacles into the soil'').\footnote{Casebook p. 
    857.}
    \item Today, equitable servitudes are conceptualized as property rights, 
    not contract rights. This matters because the original promisor can't be 
    sued once he assigns his entire interest.
    \item But, an equitable servitude arises out of a contract, so some 
    contract doctrines apply.
    \item What distinguishes equitable servitudes and real covenants?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Traditionally, the remedy for a breach of a real covenant was 
        \emph{damages} in a suit at law. The remedy for a breach of an 
        equitable servitude was an \emph{injunction} in a suit in equity.
        \item Plaintiffs usually want injunctions.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Law and equity have merged in most states, so either remedy (damages 
    or an injunction) is available. So does it matter whether a covenant is an 
    equitable servitude or a real covenant?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The Restatement (Third) says no. It merges real covenants and 
        equitable servitudes, referring to both as \textbf{covenants running 
        with the land}.\footnote{Casebook p. 858.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Creation of Covenants}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A real covenant can be created only by a signed written instrument. 
    It cannot arise by estoppel, implication, or 
    prescription.\footnote{Casebook p. 859.}
    \item An equitable servitude can arise by implication but not by 
    prescription. % TODO can it arise by estoppel?
