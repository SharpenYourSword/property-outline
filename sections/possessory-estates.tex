    grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule 
    simply persists from imitation of the past.''---Holmes.\footnote{Casebook

\subsection{Up from Feudalism}

\subsubsection{Tenure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Beginning with William the Conqueror's social system (Norman 
    Conquest, 1066). Land tenure was a central feature, in which ``one's 
    position was defined in terms of one's relationship to 
    land.''\footnote{Casebook p. 185.} All were subservient to the king.
    \item \textbf{Tenants in chief} held land in exchange for specific 
    services to the king, usually military, e.g., furnishing knights.
    \item The tenant in chief often provided his services by 
    \textbf{subinfeudation}, who provided services or subinfeudated lower 
    tenants in turn---so, a feudal pyramid developed.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item King $\rightarrow$ Tenant in chief $\rightarrow$ Mesne lord 
        $\rightarrow$ Tenant in demesne.
        \item Each layer owns the services of the layer below.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The Domesday Book recorded each tract of land in England and the 
    services by which the land is held.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Feudal Tenures and Services}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Three major types of tenure with accompanying services:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Military tenure: \textbf{knight service} (providing men to fight 
        for the king, or the money equivalent), \textbf{grand sergeantry} 
        (``splendid court life and pageantry''\footnote{Casebook p. 186.}).
        \item Economic tenure: \textbf{socage} (intended to provide 
        subsistence for overlords; e.g., money, agriculture, maintenance, or 
        other economic services). Every land grant included a service, even if 
        nominal like annual delivery of a midsummer rose.
        \item Religious: \textbf{frankalmoign}.\footnote{Casebook p. 187.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item There were also unfree tenures granted to villeins (peasants), who 
    initially had no legal protection, although courts eventually recognized 
    their holdings as on an equal footing with others.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Feudal Incidents}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Incidents}: a tenant's duties and liabilities to his lord.
    \item \textbf{Homage and fealty}: ceremonial allegiance.
    \item \textbf{Aids}: financial demands in emergencies, e.g., paying a 
    ransom to the lord's captors.
    \item \textbf{Forfeiture}: if a tenant breached his oath or refused to 
    perform feudal services, he may forfeit his land to the lord. For high 
    treason, he forfeits his land to the king.
    \item When a tenant dies:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
        \item \textbf{Wardship and marriage}: the lord can 
        hold the land for the tenant's underage heirs. The lord could also 
        sell the heir in marriage.
        \item \textbf{Relief}: the heir has to pay the lord to take control of 
        his inheritance.
        \item \textbf{Escheat}: if a tenant dies without heirs, the land goes 
        to the heirs. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Avoidance of Feudal Incidents}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Tenants developed ways of evading feudal incidents. Suppose a 
    tenant, T, holds land from L by knight service. T subinfeudated to T1, 
    ``reserving as service one rose at midsummer.''\footnote{Casebook p. 189.} 
    T was still responsible for knight service to L, but the subinfeudation 
    devalued the incidents due to L of warship, marriage, relief, and 
    escheat.
    \item Subinfeudation ended with the Statute Quia Emptores in 
    1290.\footnote{Casebook p. 190.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Decline of Feudalism}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Quia Emptores prohibited subinfeudation in fee simple, but it 
    required lords to allow tenants to transfer their land to others (with the 
    same obligations due to the lord). It had two major consequences:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Established a principle of \textbf{free alienation} of land.
        \item Existing mesne relationships disappeared, so that most land was 
        eventually held directly from the crown.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Wages rose over time, giving peasants increased independence and 
    legal rights.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Fee Simple}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Tenants have \textbf{status} as (1) tenant of the fee or (2) tenant 
    for life.
    \item Over time, status became \textbf{estate}, defined by the length of 
    time it may endure.
    \item \textbf{Fee simple} (short for fee simple absolute) can endure 
    forever. (Life estate: for the life of the person; a term of years, for 
    some period of time.)
    \item Today, the estate system makes clear (1) what property is being 
    transfered and (2) what sort of ownership is being transferred, measured 
    in the duration of the transferee's interest.\footnote{Casebook p. 191.}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{How the Fee Simple Developed}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Heritability}: under feudalism, land was not owned, but held 
    by the possessor as as tenant of another. The tenant's holding 
    (\textbf{fee} or \textbf{fief}) could not be inherited, although the lord 
    would often give it to the heir on payment of relief. Heritability of land 
    gradually arose as a right over time.
    \item \textbf{Alienability}: By the end of the thirteenth century, Quia Emptores 
    ensured that the fee was freely alienable during the tenant's life.
    \item \textbf{Fee simple estate}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Alienability allowed tenants to pass land to others and their 
        heirs, causing holdings to become \textbf{freehold estates} that were 
        not terminable at the lord's will.\footnote{Casebook p. 193.}
        \item \textbf{Estate in land}: e.g., a fee simple---a legal 
        abstraction that we treat as a physical thing (it can be given, sold, 
        bequeathed; creditors can seize it). Estates ``vest, divest, merge, 
        are destroyed, shift, spring.''\footnote{Casebook p. 193.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item ``The fee simple absolute is as close to unlimited ownership as our 
    law recognizes. It is the largest estate in terms of duration. It may 
    endure forever.''\footnote{Casebook p. 194.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Creation of a Fee Simple}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item At early common law, a fee simple was created by conveying land ``to 
    A and his heirs.''
    \item ``And his heirs'' are \textbf{words of limitation}, meaning that the 
    heirs do not take as ``purchasers,'' i.e., they do not have an interest in 
    the land. (They have an interest only after A's death.)
    \item ``To A'' are \textbf{words of purchase}, meaning A is the grantee.
    \item Adding ``and his heirs'' is no longer necessary to create a fee 
    simple, but lawyers still do it out of habit and caution.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Problems on Fee Simple Creation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In 1600, O conveys property ``to A for life, then to B forever.'' 
    What estates do A and B have? If A dies and then B dies, who owns the 
    property? What if the conveyance happens in 2002?\footnote{Casebook p. 194 
    problem 1. See reader p. 36, I and II.} % TODO
    ~\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    \item O conveys property to ``to A and her heirs.'' A's only child runs up 
    large bills. B's creditors can attach B's property to satisfy their 
    claims. Does B have an interest in the property, reachable by B's 
    creditors? What if A wants to sell the property and take a trip around the 
    world---can B stop her?\footnote{Casebook p. 195 problem 3.} % TODO
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item B does not acquire an interest in the property until A's death. 
        So, B's creditors cannot reach the property, and B cannot stop A from 
        selling the property.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Inheritance of a Fee Simple}

\paragraph{Heirs}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Heirs are intestate successors. A living person has no heirs, and 
    heirs only matter if the person dies intestate.
    \item In all states today, the surviving spouse is an intestate successor. 
    The size of the spouse's share depends on other survivors.
    \item Statutes of descent prefer heirs in this order (after spouses):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item First issue.
        \item Parents.
        \item Collaterals.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Issue}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Issue = descendants---children, grandchildren, and on down.
    \item ``Per stirpes'' = ``by the stocks,'' meaning if a child of the 
    decedent dies before the decedent but leaves children who survive, the 
    child's share goes to the child's children.
    \item Until 1925, rules of primogeniture controlled inheritance. Children 
    born out of wedlock were \emph{filius nullius}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Ancestors}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Parents take as heirs if the decedent leaves no issue.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Collaterals}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Collateral kin are people related by blood who are neither 
    descendants nor ancestors---brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, uncles, 
    aunts, and cousins.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Escheat}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item If a person dies without heirs, the property goes to the state.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Problems on Inheritance of a Fee Simple}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item O has two children, A (daughter) and B (son). B dies testate, 
    leaving all of his property to W, his wife. B is survived by B1 
    (daughter), B2 (son), and B3 (daughter). A1 (son) is born to A. O then 
    dies intestate.\footnote{Casebook p. 196 problem 1.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Who owns the property in England in 1800?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item B2, under primogeniture.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Who owns the property under modern American law?
        % TODO -- see notes
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Defeasible Estates}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A \textbf{defeasible} estate ends prior to its natural end point 
    when a specified event occurs. For instance, a normal life estate ends 
    when the life tenant dies, but a \emph{defeasible} life estate ends when a 
    condition in the conveyance is satisfied---e.g., O conveys property to A 
    ``so long as the property is only used for residential 
    purposes.''\footnote{Casebook p. 223.}
    \item Defeasible fees are mainly used to control land use (``this land can 
    only be used for school purposes'') or behavior (``this land is yours as 
    long as you don't drink'').
    \item Three types:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Fee simple determinable}: ends automatially when a 
        stated event happens. The language must include a ``durational 
        aspect.'' For instance, ``\emph{so long as} the land is used for 
        school purposes.''\footnote{Casebook p. 223.}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \emph{Future interest}: \textbf{possibility of 
            reverter}---O, the transferor, or his heirs retain the future 
            interest. It arises because O has transferred less than his entire 
            interest when he creates a determinable fee.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Fee simple subject to condition subsequent}: % TODO

        \item \textbf{Fee simple subject to executory limitation}: 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\emph{Transferability of Future Interests: Mahrenholz v. County 
Board of School Trustees}}

The right of reentry cannot be transferred, because the holder of the right 
does not possess the property until he exercises his right of reentry. But it 
might be possible to transfer a possibility of reverter. The difference 
between these two types of future interests depends on the language used to 
create them. Language with a ``durational aspect'' (while, during, until, 
etc.) creates a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter, while 
conditional words (upon the condition, provided that) create a fee simple 
subject to condition subsequent with the right of reentry.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Timeline:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item March 18, 1941: the Huttons conveyed 1.5 acres (the ``Hutton 
        School grounds'') out of 40 acres to the school district. The deed 
        provided that ``this land to be used for school purpose only; 
        otherwise to revert to Grantors herein.''\footnote{Casebook p. 226.}
        \item July 1941: the Huttons conveyed the remaining 38.5 acres to the 
        Jacqmains. The deed also purported to convey the reversionary 
        interest in the 1.5 acres that had been conveyed to the school.
        \item July 18, 1951: Mr. Hutton died intestate.
        \item February 18, 1969: Mrs. Hutton died intestate. The Huttons' only 
        legal heir was their son Harry.
        \item October 9, 1959: the Jacqmains conveyed the 38.5 acres and the 
        reversionary interest in the 1.5 acres to the Mahrenholzes.
        \item May 30, 1973: the school stopped holding classes at the school 
        that was built on the land. The school district continued to use the 
        buildings for storage.
        \item May 7, 1977: Harry Hutton conveyed to the Mahrenholzes all of 
        his interest in the Hutton School land. The document was filed on May 
        7, 1977. On September 6, Hutton disclaimed his interest in the 
        property in favor of the Mahrenholzes.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The Mahrenholzes sued to quiet title to the school property in 
    themselves. The trial court dismissed the complaint, holding that the 
    conveyance from the Huttons to the school district created a fee simple 
    subject to a condition subsequent followed by the right of entry for 
    condition broken, rather than a determinable fee followed by a possibility 
    of reverter.\footnote{Casebook p. 227.}
    \item ``The basic issue presented by this appeal is whether the trial 
    court correctly concluded that the plaintiffs could not have acquired any 
    interest in the school property from the Jacqmains and Harry 
    Hutton.''\footnote{Casebook p. 227.}
    \item The type of defeasible fee created by the original conveyance to the 
    school board is in dispute. It depends on how the court interprets the 
    language in the conveyance. But the only two possible future interests 
    that could have been created are (1) a possibility of reverter or (2) a 
    right of reentry. Neither of these future interests are transferable 
    inter vivos under Illinois law, so ``the trial court correctly ruled that 
    the plaintiffs could not have acquired any interest in that property from 
    the Jacqmains by the deed of October 9, 1959.''\footnote{Casebook p. 227.}
    \item The next question is whether the Mahrenholzes could have acquired in 
    interest in the Hutton School grounds directly from Harry Hutton. It 
    depends on the language of the original 1941 deed conveying the land from 
    the Huttons to the school district. The Mahrenholzes argued that it 
    created a fee simple determinable followed by a possibility of reverter. 
    The defendants argued (and the trial court held) that it created a fee 
    simple subject to a condition subsequent followed by a right of reentry 
    for condition broken.
    \item Neither future interest is alienable or devisable, but both are 
    inheritable.
    \item Critically, if Harry Hutton had a right of reentry, he did not own 
    the school property until he exercised his right. But if he had a 
    possibility of reverter, the property became his automatically as soon as 
    it was no longer used for school purposes. So, the Mahrenholzes could only 
    have an interest in the property if Harry had acquired a possibility of 
    reverter, not a right to reentry.
    \item The difference between a fee simple determinable and a fee simple 
    subject to condition subsequent hangs on the terminology. Words with a 
    durational aspect (so long as, while, until) would have created a fee 
    simple determinable. Words creating a condition (upon condition that, 
    provided that) would have created a fee simple subject to condition 
    subsequent.
    \item Here the court held that the word ``only'' was intended to create a 
    fee simple determinable followed by the possibility of reverter. Thus, 
    when the property was no longer used for school purposes, Harry Hutton 
    automatically became the owner. It was therefore possible that he could 
    have conveyed his interest to the Mahrenholzes, though the appellate court 
    here left that issue for the trial court to resolve.
