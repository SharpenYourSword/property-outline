\section{Themes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dividing up ownership---over time, among multiple 
    people,~.~.~.~---and why?
    \item Types of property holders, and their rights and obligations.
    \item What the rule \emph{is} vs. what the rule \emph{should be}. Much of 
    property law is uncertain and contested.
    \item What is property? Things; rights; ideas (e.g., IP); relationships, 
    especially with regard to economically valuable resources.
    \item ``Property is everything which has an exchangeable 
    value~.~.~.~''\footnote{\emph{The Slaughter-House Cases}, 83 U.S. 36, 127 
    (1873) (Swayne, J., dissenting).} What about property that has no exchange value?
    \item Precedent vs. policy.
\end{enumerate}
