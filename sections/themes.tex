\section{Themes}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Dividing up ownership---over time, among multiple 
    people,~.~.~.~---and why?
    \item Types of property holders, and their rights and obligations.
    \item What the rule \emph{is} vs. what the rule \emph{should be}. Much of 
    property law is uncertain and contested.
    \item What is property? Things; rights; ideas (e.g., IP); relationships, 
    especially with regard to economically valuable resources.
\end{enumerate}
